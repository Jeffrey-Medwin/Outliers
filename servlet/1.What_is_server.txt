SERVLET:
	The servlet got two tags they are
		Servlet tag -> class name
		Servlet mapping tag -> URL pattern

What is SERVLET?
	~ It is a techonology used to create web application.
	~ It is an API that provides interfaces and classes including documents.
	~ Servlet is a interface that must be implemented to create a servlet.
	~ Servlet is a class that extends the capabilities of the servers and responds to the incoming requests. It can respond to any requests.
	~ Servlet is a web component that is deployed on server to create dynamic web page

How servlet works?
	There are two components. They are client and a server.

	The clinet makes a request to the server and then the server responds to the client by processing the request.

	These request are of two types. They are
		-> Static 
		-> Dynamic

STATIC:
	These are the pages that are already build and the server gives the build page to the client

DYNAMIC:	
	These pages are not build by default. they are to be made when the request has been given

	So there will be a helper application which is known as SERVLET.

	To have Dynamic pages we need to use web containers.

WEB CONTAINERS:
	The web containers have multiple Servlet. which will be called when their speified request has be got.

How to avoid XML?
	In the server 3.0 we have got annotations. These are used to map the servlet.
