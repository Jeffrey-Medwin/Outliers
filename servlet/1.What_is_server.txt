How servlet works?
	There are two components. They are client and a server.

	The clinet makes a request to the server and then the server responds to the client by processing the request.

	These request are of two types. They are
		-> Static 
		-> Dynamic

STATIC:
	These are the pages that are already build and the server gives the build page to the client

DYNAMIC:	
	These pages are not build by default. they are to be made when the request has been given

	So there will be a helper application which is known as SERVLET.

	To have Dynamic pages we need to use web containers.

WEB CONTAINERS:o
	The web containers have multiple Servlet. which will be called when their speified request has be got.

SERVLET:
	The servlet got two tags they are
		Servlet tag -> class name
		Servlet mapping tag -> URL pattern

How to avoid XML?
	In the server 3.0 we have got annotations. These are used to map the servlet.
